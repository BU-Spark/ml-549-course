    "\n",
    "1. **Import Necessary Libraries:**\n",

    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras import layers, models\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10\n",
    "```\n",
    "This imports the required TensorFlow libraries, Keras layers and models, and the CIFAR10 dataset from Keras datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load and Preprocess the CIFAR10 Dataset:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = cifar10.load_data()\n",
    "train_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n",
    "test_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `cifar10.load_data()` loads the CIFAR10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It returns two tuples: one for the training set (50,000 images) and another for the test set (10,000 images).\n",
    "- The images are then normalized to have values between 0 and 1 by converting their datatype to `float32` and dividing by 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define the Model:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = models.Sequential([\n",
    "    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),\n",

    "- A sequential model is defined using Keras. This means that layers are added in sequence.\n",
    "- `Conv2D` layers are convolutional layers that process the image in 2D slices. They are instrumental in capturing spatial features.\n",
    "- `MaxPooling2D` layers are pooling layers that reduce the spatial dimensions of the image, keeping the most prominent features.\n",
    "- `Flatten` layer is used to flatten the 2D arrays for fully connected layers.\n",
    "- `Dense` layers are fully connected layers. The final dense layer has 10 units, corresponding to the 10 classes of CIFAR10.\n",

    "```\n",
    "- The model is compiled using the Adam optimization algorithm.\n",
    "- The loss function used is `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems where labels are integers. The `from_logits=True` argument means that the model will output logits (values before activation), and this loss function will apply the softmax activation for us.\n",
    "- The metric used to evaluate the model during training and testing is accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Train the Model:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, \n",
    "                    validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))\n",

    "- The model is trained using the training images and labels for 10 epochs.\n",
    "- Validation data (test images and labels) is provided to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data after each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluate the Model:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)\n",
    "print(f\"\\nTest accuracy: {test_acc}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to determine its performance.\n",
    "- The test accuracy is printed to provide a measure of how well the model classifies new, unseen images.\n",
