title: "Command Shells"

# Introduction

Although there are a lot of great GUI-based machine learning applications, there
are many cases when it is more productive to use command line interfaces, for
example with `git` or `python`. We'll get you familiar with command shells for 
Windows and MacOS here. In the next section we'll cover the Shared Computing Cluster
at BU and its Linux operating system.

Topics to cover:

1. why important (the basic control language for machine learning)
2. MacOS (zsh) versus Windows (terminal and linux subsystem) versus linux distributions (e.g. SCC)

## Getting to a command shell

The types and how you start command shells varies by operating system.

### MacOS

In MacOS, start the `terminal` app. ![MacoS Terminal](assets/images/macos_terminal_icon.jpeg){width="30px"} 

Starting with MacOS Catalina, the default shell is [`zsh`](https://zsh.org/). If
you've upgraded from an earlier version of Catalina, you might still be using `bash`
shell.  If you are still using `bash`, there should be reminder everytime you
open Terminal instructing how you switch to `zsh`.

The reason it is important to know which cell you are running is that the shell
startup configuration files are particular to the shell. There are some other
subtle differences in shell commands and syntax.

You can see which shell you are running with the process status command `ps`. 
One or more of the processes listed will include `bash` or `zsh`.

### SCC

The easiest way to get to a terminal session on the Shared Computing Cluster (SCC)
is to navigate to [SCC On Demand](https://scc-ondemand.bu.edu).

You can also `ssh` to <username>@scc1.bu.edu or <username>@scc2.bu.edu or
 <username>@scc3.bu.edu, the login nodes.

 The first time you `ssh`, you might get the message a like this with `scc1`:

 ```
 The authenticity of host 'scc2.bu.edu (192.12.187.131)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:OmvL4FQ48QTpcXDpYE63rse1tM6pfKfSUgaVW1+mlIw.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```

Just type yes and hit `return`.
