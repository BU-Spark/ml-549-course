# Fall 2024 Lecture Topics

This folder (`lectures/fa24`) contains draft lectures for various introductory
practical machine tools.

The topic list is in [index.qmd](./index.qmd).

It is in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) website format.

To edit, preview and render you'll need to setup Quarto.

1. Install Quarto as directed in Quarto
 [Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
2. We suggest you edit with VS Code and the 
[Quarto Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto).
3. From VS Code you can preview using
    1. the preview icon on the top right of one of the qmd edit panels, or
    2. run `quarto preview` from the integrated VS Code terminal from the 
    `lectures/fa24` directory.

There are placeholder files for each of the major topics. If you add a new
file or change a file name, be sure to update it in [_quarto.yml](./_quarto.yml)
file too.

**Coming Soon:** Instructions on how to render slides from quarto.
